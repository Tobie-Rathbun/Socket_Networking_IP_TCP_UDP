Sockets are used to communicate data across a local area network or the internet
Run a Python file, then run another, and observe the Terminal outputs
Internet example sends a video file across the internet, and the server must be run on a separate machine (WIP)
Local examples all work as expected, but make sure to start the servers (receiving) before the clients (sending)
