<!-- This code creates a simple website with a form that allows users to enter text. When the form is submitted, the input text is sent to the server as a POST request. The server receives the input text and sends it to the Python application using a TCP socket. The server then sends a response to the client indicating that the request was successful.

This code sets up a simple server that listens for POST requests on port 8000 and sends the input text to a Python application running on localhost at port 10000. The Python application can then process the input text and send a response back to the server, if necessary.

To use this code, you will need to run the server script on a machine that is accessible to both the website and the Python application. You will also need to set up the client-side code in the Python application to receive the input text and process it as needed.-->
